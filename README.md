# Simon Game

Hello and welcome to my second milestone project. For this project I chose to create my version of the simon game, as I like the attention to detail and love the challenge I think that this would be the right selection for me.
The Simon Game is a memory game and was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978.
The project is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Description
Simon plays a random sequence for the player to repeat using colours and sounds. The player has to repeat the same sequence as Simon to win the game, this sequence will get longer and longer if the player gets the right sequence, if he gets it wrong the counter will get to 0 and player needs to start over.
